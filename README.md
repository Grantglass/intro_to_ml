&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to Machine Learning as a part of the 2021 TAP Institute's summer courses. In this first day notebook, we will go over the core concepts of machine learning and start to get our feet wet with. I will not be providing you a complete overview, but rather a quick way to get a genereal understanding about what machine learning is and how it works. In days two and three, we will be exploring different machine learning techniques more in depth.
